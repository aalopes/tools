This is a set of very simple Bash scripts which I tend to use regularly. 
They are not in any way meant to be user friendly, i.e. there's usually
no user prompt or anything.

Most of them can, in any case, be re-written in a couple of seconds
but I still decided to upload them since they might be useful.

They are not even worth licensing, but since I don't like leaving
things in the open domain, I went for the very permissing 2-clause
FreeBSD license.

Note that some of these might only work on Bash >= 4.0 .
